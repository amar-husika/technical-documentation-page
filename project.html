            <h1>Introduction 1</h1>
            <p>To understand C++ is to understand the forces that drove its creation, the ideas
                that shaped it, and the legacy it inherits. Thus, the story of C++ begins with C.
                This chapter presents an overview of the C programming language, its origins, its
                uses, and its underlying philosophy. Since C++ is built upon C, this chapter provides
                an important historical perspective on the roots of C++. Much of what makes C++
                what it is had its genesis in the C language.</p>
            <h2>The origin of C</h2>
            <p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an
                older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the
                development of C in the 1970s.
                For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the Unix
                version 5 operating system. It was first described in The C Programming Language by
                Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978). In the
                summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an ANSI (American National
                Standards Institute) standard that would define the C language once and for all. The
                standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
                becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (International
                Standards Organization) and is now referred to as the ANSI/ISO C standard. For
                simplicity, this book will use the term Standard C when referring to the ANSI/ISO C
                standard. Today, all mainstream C/C++ compilers comply with Standard C. Standard
                C is the foundation upon which C++ is built.</p>
            <h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
            <p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less
                powerful, harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC
                or Pascal, nor does it imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language
                (and its associated troubles). Rather, C is thought of as a middle-level language because
                it combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and flexibilityof
                assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the spectrum of computer
                languages.
                As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and
                addressesâ€”the basic elements with which the computer functions. Despite this fact
                C code is also very portable. Portability means that it is easy to adapt software written
                for one type of computer or operating system to another. For example, if you can easily
                convert a program written for DOS so that it runs under Windows, that program is
                portable.
                All high-level programming languages support the concept of data types. A data
                type defines a set of values that a variable can store along with a set of operations that
                can be performed on that variable. Common data types are integer, character, and real.
                Although C has five basic built-in data types, it is not a strongly typed language, as are
                Pascal and Ada. C permits almost all type conversions. For example, you may freely
                intermix character and integer types in an expression.
                Unlike a high-level language, C performs almost no run-time error checking. For
                example, no check is performed to ensure that array boundaries are not overrun. These
                types of checks are the responsibility of the programmer.
                In the same vein, C does not demand strict type compatibility between a parameter
                and an argument. As you may know from your other programming experience, a
                high-level computer language will typically require that the type of an argument be
                (more or less) exactly the same type as the parameter that will receive the argument.
                However, such is not the case for C. Instead, C allows an argument to be of any type
                as long as it can be reasonably converted into the type of the parameter. Further, C
                provides all of the automatic conversions to accomplish this.
                C is special in that it allows the direct manipulation of bits, bytes, words, and
                pointers. This makes it well suited for system-level programming, where these
                operations are common.
                Another important aspect of C is that it has only 32 keywords (27 from the
                Kernighan and Ritchie de facto standard, and five added by the ANSI standardization
                committee), which are the commands that make up the C language. High-level
                languages typically have several times more keywords. As a comparison, consider
                that most versions of BASIC have well over 100 keywords!</p>
            <h2>C Is a Structured Language</h2>
            <p>In your previous programming experience, you may have heard the term blockstructured
                applied to a computer language. Although the term block-structured
                language does not strictly apply to C, C is commonly referred to simply as a
                structured language. It has many similarities to other structured languages, such
                as ALGOL, Pascal, and Modula-2.
                The reason that C (and C++) is not, technically, a block-structured language is that
                block-structured languages permit procedures or functions to be declared inside
                other procedures or functions. Since C does not allow the creation of functions
                within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.
                The distinguishing feature of a structured language is compartmentalization of code
                and data. This is the ability of a language to section off and hide from the rest of the
                program all information and instructions necessary to perform a specific task. One
                way that you achieve compartmentalization is by using subroutines that employ local
                (temporary) variables. By using local variables, you can write subroutines so that the
                events that occur within them cause no side effects in other parts of the program. This
                capability makes it very easy for programs to share sections of code. If you develop
                compartmentalized functions, you only need to know what a function does, not how it
                does it. Remember, excessive use of global variables (variables known throughout the
                entire program) may allow bugs to creep into a program by allowing unwanted side
                effects. (Anyone who has programmed in standard BASIC is well aware of this
                problem.)
                The concept of compartmentalization is greatly expanded by C++. Specifically, in
                C++, one part of your program may tightly control which other parts of your
                program are allowed access.
                A structured language allows you a variety of programming possibilities. It
                directly supports several loop constructs, such as while, do-while, and for. In a
                structured language, the use of goto is either prohibited or discouraged and is not the
                common form of program control (as is the case in standard BASIC and traditional FORTRAN, for example).
                A structured language allows you to place statements
                anywhere on a line and does not require a strict field concept (as some older
                FORTRANs do).
                Here are some examples of structured and nonstructured languages:</p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; justify: space-between;">
                <div style="margin-right: 5%;">
                    <ul>Nonstructured: </ul>
                    <li>FORTRAN</li>
                    <li>BASIC</li>
                    <li>COBOL</li>
                </div>
                <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                    <ul>Structured: </ul>
                    <li>Pascal</li>
                    <li>Ada</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>Modula-2</li>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Structured languages tend to be modern. In fact, a mark of an old computer
                language is that it is nonstructured. Today, few programmers would consider using
                a nonstructured language for serious, new programs.
                New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.
                BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings of these languages can never be
                fully mitigated because they were not designed with structured features from the
                beginning.
                C's main structural component is the functionâ€”C's stand-alone subroutine. In
                C, functions are the building blocks in which all program activity occurs. They let
                you define and code separately the separate tasks in a program, thus allowing your
                programs to be modular. After you have created a function, you can rely on it to
                work properly in various situations without creating side effects in other parts of
                the program. Being able to create stand-alone functions is extremely critical in larger
                projects where one programmer's code must not accidentally affect another's.
                Another way to structure and compartmentalize code in C is through the use of
                code blocks. A code block is a logically connected group of program statements that is
                treated as a unit. In C, you create a code block by placing a sequence of statements
                between opening and closing curly braces. In this example,</p>
            <div class="code"">

                <code>
                        if (x < 10) { <br>
                            printf(" Too low, try again.\n"); <br>
                scanf("%d", &x); <br>
                } <br>
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>the two statements after the if and between the curly braces are both executed if x is
                less than 10. These two statements together with the braces represent a code block.
                They are a logical unit: One of the statements cannot execute without the other
                executing also. Code blocks allow many algorithms to be implemented with clarity,
                elegance, and efficiency. Moreover, they help the programmer better conceptualize
                the true nature of the algorithm being implemented.</p>

            <h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
            <p>the classic examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was
                designed not to better the programmer's lot, nor to improve the reliability of the code
                produced, nor even to improve the speed with which code can be written. Rather,
                COBOL was designed, in part, to enable nonprogrammers to read and presumably
                (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was created essentially to allow
                nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple problems.
                In contrast, C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers.
                The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants: few
                restrictions, few complaints, block structures, stand-alone functions, and a compact
                set of keywords. By using C, you can nearly achieve the efficiency of assembly code
                combined with the structure of ALGOL or Modula-2. It's no wonder that C and C++
                are easily the most popular languages among topflight professional programmers.
                The fact that you can often use C in place of assembly language is a major factor in
                its popularity among programmers. Assembly language uses a symbolic representation
                of the actual binary code that the computer executes directly. Each assembly-language
                operation maps into a single task for the computer to perform. Although assembly
                language gives programmers the potential to accomplish tasks with maximum
                flexibility and efficiency, it is notoriously difficult to work with when developing and
                debugging a program. Furthermore, since assembly language is unstructured, the final
                program tends to be spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled mess of jumps, calls, and indexes. This
                lack of structure makes assembly-language programs difficult to read, enhance, and
                maintain. Perhaps more important, assembly-language routines are not portable
                between machines with different central processing units (CPUs).
                Initially,C was used for systems programming. A systems program forms a portion
                of the operating system of the computer or its support utilities. For example, the
                following are usually called systems programs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating systems</li>
                <li>Interpreters</li>
                <li>Editors</li>
                <li>File utilities</li>
                <li>Performance enhancers</li>
                <li>Real-time executives</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As C grew in popularity, many programmers began to use it to program all tasks
                because of its portability and efficiencyâ€”and because they liked it! At the time of its
                creation, C was a much longed-for, dramatic improvement in programming languages.
                Of course, C++ has carried on this tradition.
                With the advent of C++, some thought that C as a distinct language would die
                out. Such has not been the case. First, not all programs require the application of the
                object-oriented programming features provided by C++. For example, applications
                such as embedded systems are still typically programmed in C. Second, much of the
                world still runs on C code, and those programs will continue to be enhanced and
                maintained. While C's greatest legacy is as the foundation for C++, it will continue to
                be a vibrant, widely used language for many years to come.</p>

            <h2>The Form of a C Program</h2>
            <p>Table 1-2 lists the 32 keywords that, combined with the formal C syntax, form the C
                programming language. Of these, 27 were defined by the original version of C. These
                five were added by the ANSI C committee: enum, const, signed, void, and volatile.
                All are, of course, part of the C++ language.</p>

            <p>In addition, many compilers have added several keywords that better exploit their
                operating environment. For example, several compilers include keywords to manage
                the memory organization of the 8086 family of processors, to support inter-language
                programming, and to access interrupts. Here is a list of some commonly used extended

            <p>Your compiler may also support other extensions that help it take better advantage
                of its specific environment.
                All C (and C++) keywords are lowercase. Also, uppercase and lowercase are
                different: else is a keyword; ELSE is not. You may not use a keyword for any other
                purpose in a programâ€”that is, you may not use it as a variable or function name.
                All C programs consist of one or more functions. The only function that must be
                present is called main() , which is the first function called when program execution
                begins. In well-written C code, main() contains what is, in essence, an outline of what
                the program does. The outline is composed of function calls. Although main() is not
                a keyword, treat it as if it were. For example, don't try to use main() as the name of a
                variable because you will probably confuse the compiler.
                The general form of a C program is illustrated in Figure 1-1, where f1() through
                fN() represent user-defined functions.</p>

            <h2>The Library and Linking</h2>
            <p>Technically speaking, you can create a useful, functional C or C++ program that
                consists solely of the statements that you actually created. However, this is quite
                rare because neither C nor C++ provides any keywords that perform such things as
                input/output (I/O) operations, high-level mathematical computations, or character
                handling. As a result, most programs include calls to various functions contained in
                the standard library.
                All C++ compilers come with a standard library of functions that perform most
                commonly needed tasks. Standard C++ specifies a minimal set of functions that will be
                supported by all compilers. However, your compiler will probably contain many other
                functions. For example, the standard library does not define any graphics functions,
                but your compiler will probably include some.
                The C++ standard library can be divided into two halves: the standard function
                library and the class library. The standard function library is inherited from the C
                language. C++ supports the entire function library defined by Standard C. Thus, all
                of the standard C functions are available for use in C++ programs that you write.</p>

            <p>In addition to the standard function library, C++ also defines its own class library.
                The class library provides object-oriented routines that your programs may use. It also
                defines the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers off-the-shelf solutions to a
                variety of programming problems. However, both the class library and the STL are
                discussed later in this book. In Part One, only the standard function library is used,
                since it is the only one that is also defined by C.
                The implementors of your compiler have already written most of the generalpurpose
                functions that you will use. When you call a function that is not part of your
                program, the compiler "remembers" its name. Later, the linker combines the code you wrote with the
                object code already found in the standard library. This process is called
                linking. Some compilers have their own linker, while others use the standard linker
                supplied by the operating system.
                The functions in the library are in relocatable format. This means that the memory
                addresses for the various machine-code instructions have not been absolutely
                definedâ€”only offset information has been kept. When your program links with the
                functions in the standard library, these memory offsets are used to create the actual
                addresses used. There are several technical manuals and books that explain this
                process in more detail. However, you do not need any further explanation of the
                relocation process to program in C++.
                Many of the functions that you will need as you write programs are in the standard
                library. They act as building blocks that you combine. If you write a function that you
                will use again and again, you can place it into a library, too.</p>

            <h2>Separate Compilation</h2>
            <p>Most short programs are completely contained within one source file. However, as a
                program's length grows, so does its compile time (and long compile times make for
                short tempers). Hence, C/C++ allows a program to be contained in many files and lets
                you compile each file separately. Once you have compiled all files, they are linked,
                along with any library routines, to form the complete object code. The advantage of
                separate compilation is that if you change the code of one file, you do not need to
                recompile the entire program. On all but the simplest projects, this saves a substantial
                amount of time. The user documentation to your C/C++ compiler will contain
                instructions for compiling multifile programs.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the .C and .CPP File Extensions</h2>
            <p>The programs in Part One of this book are, of course, valid C++ programs and can be
                compiled using any modern C++ compiler. They are also valid C programs and can be
                compiled using a C compiler. Thus, if you are called upon to write C programs, the
                ones shown in Part One qualify as examples. Traditionally, C programs use the file
                extension .C, and C++ programs use the extension .CPP. A C++ compiler uses the file
                extension to determine what type of program it is compiling. This is important because
                the compiler assumes that any program using the .C extension is a C program and that
                any file using .CPP is a C++ program. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, you may use
                either extension for the programs in Part One. However, the programs in the rest of
                this book will require .CPP.
                One last point: Although C is a subset of C++, there are a few minor differences
                between the two languages, and in a few cases, you may need to compile a C program
                as a C program (using the .C extension). Any instances of this will be noted.</p>

            <section id="introduction2" class="main-section">
                <h1>Introduction 2</h1>
                <p>To understand C++ is to understand the forces that drove its creation, the ideas
                    that shaped it, and the legacy it inherits. Thus, the story of C++ begins with C.
                    This chapter presents an overview of the C programming language, its origins, its
                    uses, and its underlying philosophy. Since C++ is built upon C, this chapter provides
                    an important historical perspective on the roots of C++. Much of what makes C++
                    what it is had its genesis in the C language.</p>
                <h2>The origin of C</h2>
                <p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                    the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an
                    older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                    influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the
                    development of C in the 1970s.
                    For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the Unix
                    version 5 operating system. It was first described in The C Programming Language by
                    Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978). In the
                    summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an ANSI (American National
                    Standards Institute) standard that would define the C language once and for all. The
                    standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                    The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
                    becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (International
                    Standards Organization) and is now referred to as the ANSI/ISO C standard. For
                    simplicity, this book will use the term Standard C when referring to the ANSI/ISO C
                    standard. Today, all mainstream C/C++ compilers comply with Standard C. Standard
                    C is the foundation upon which C++ is built.</p>
                <h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
                <p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less
                    powerful, harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC
                    or Pascal, nor does it imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language
                    (and its associated troubles). Rather, C is thought of as a middle-level language because
                    it combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and flexibilityof
                    assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the spectrum of computer
                    languages.
                    As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and
                    addressesâ€”the basic elements with which the computer functions. Despite this fact
                    C code is also very portable. Portability means that it is easy to adapt software written
                    for one type of computer or operating system to another. For example, if you can easily
                    convert a program written for DOS so that it runs under Windows, that program is
                    portable.
                    All high-level programming languages support the concept of data types. A data
                    type defines a set of values that a variable can store along with a set of operations that
                    can be performed on that variable. Common data types are integer, character, and real.
                    Although C has five basic built-in data types, it is not a strongly typed language, as are
                    Pascal and Ada. C permits almost all type conversions. For example, you may freely
                    intermix character and integer types in an expression.
                    Unlike a high-level language, C performs almost no run-time error checking. For
                    example, no check is performed to ensure that array boundaries are not overrun. These
                    types of checks are the responsibility of the programmer.
                    In the same vein, C does not demand strict type compatibility between a parameter
                    and an argument. As you may know from your other programming experience, a
                    high-level computer language will typically require that the type of an argument be
                    (more or less) exactly the same type as the parameter that will receive the argument.
                    However, such is not the case for C. Instead, C allows an argument to be of any type
                    as long as it can be reasonably converted into the type of the parameter. Further, C
                    provides all of the automatic conversions to accomplish this.
                    C is special in that it allows the direct manipulation of bits, bytes, words, and
                    pointers. This makes it well suited for system-level programming, where these
                    operations are common.
                    Another important aspect of C is that it has only 32 keywords (27 from the
                    Kernighan and Ritchie de facto standard, and five added by the ANSI standardization
                    committee), which are the commands that make up the C language. High-level
                    languages typically have several times more keywords. As a comparison, consider
                    that most versions of BASIC have well over 100 keywords!</p>
                <h2>C Is a Structured Language</h2>
                <p>In your previous programming experience, you may have heard the term blockstructured
                    applied to a computer language. Although the term block-structured
                    language does not strictly apply to C, C is commonly referred to simply as a
                    structured language. It has many similarities to other structured languages, such
                    as ALGOL, Pascal, and Modula-2.
                    The reason that C (and C++) is not, technically, a block-structured language is that
                    block-structured languages permit procedures or functions to be declared inside
                    other procedures or functions. Since C does not allow the creation of functions
                    within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.
                    The distinguishing feature of a structured language is compartmentalization of code
                    and data. This is the ability of a language to section off and hide from the rest of the
                    program all information and instructions necessary to perform a specific task. One
                    way that you achieve compartmentalization is by using subroutines that employ local
                    (temporary) variables. By using local variables, you can write subroutines so that the
                    events that occur within them cause no side effects in other parts of the program. This
                    capability makes it very easy for programs to share sections of code. If you develop
                    compartmentalized functions, you only need to know what a function does, not how it
                    does it. Remember, excessive use of global variables (variables known throughout the
                    entire program) may allow bugs to creep into a program by allowing unwanted side
                    effects. (Anyone who has programmed in standard BASIC is well aware of this
                    problem.)
                    The concept of compartmentalization is greatly expanded by C++. Specifically, in
                    C++, one part of your program may tightly control which other parts of your
                    program are allowed access.
                    A structured language allows you a variety of programming possibilities. It
                    directly supports several loop constructs, such as while, do-while, and for. In a
                    structured language, the use of goto is either prohibited or discouraged and is not the
                    common form of program control (as is the case in standard BASIC and traditional FORTRAN, for
                    example).
                    A structured language allows you to place statements
                    anywhere on a line and does not require a strict field concept (as some older
                    FORTRANs do).
                    Here are some examples of structured and nonstructured languages:</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; justify: space-between;">
                    <div style="margin-right: 5%;">
                        <ul>Nonstructured: </ul>
                        <li>FORTRAN</li>
                        <li>BASIC</li>
                        <li>COBOL</li>
                    </div>
                    <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                        <ul>Structured: </ul>
                        <li>Pascal</li>
                        <li>Ada</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>C</li>
                        <li>Modula-2</li>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Structured languages tend to be modern. In fact, a mark of an old computer
                    language is that it is nonstructured. Today, few programmers would consider using
                    a nonstructured language for serious, new programs.
                    New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.
                    BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings of these languages can never be
                    fully mitigated because they were not designed with structured features from the
                    beginning.
                    C's main structural component is the functionâ€”C's stand-alone subroutine. In
                    C, functions are the building blocks in which all program activity occurs. They let
                    you define and code separately the separate tasks in a program, thus allowing your
                    programs to be modular. After you have created a function, you can rely on it to
                    work properly in various situations without creating side effects in other parts of
                    the program. Being able to create stand-alone functions is extremely critical in larger
                    projects where one programmer's code must not accidentally affect another's.
                    Another way to structure and compartmentalize code in C is through the use of
                    code blocks. A code block is a logically connected group of program statements that is
                    treated as a unit. In C, you create a code block by placing a sequence of statements
                    between opening and closing curly braces. In this example,</p>
                <div class="code"">
    
                    <code>
                            if (x < 10) { <br>
                                printf(" Too low, try again.\n"); <br>
                    scanf("%d", &x); <br>
                    } <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>the two statements after the if and between the curly braces are both executed if x is
                    less than 10. These two statements together with the braces represent a code block.
                    They are a logical unit: One of the statements cannot execute without the other
                    executing also. Code blocks allow many algorithms to be implemented with clarity,
                    elegance, and efficiency. Moreover, they help the programmer better conceptualize
                    the true nature of the algorithm being implemented.</p>

                <h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
                <p>the classic examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was
                    designed not to better the programmer's lot, nor to improve the reliability of the code
                    produced, nor even to improve the speed with which code can be written. Rather,
                    COBOL was designed, in part, to enable nonprogrammers to read and presumably
                    (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was created essentially to allow
                    nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple problems.
                    In contrast, C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers.
                    The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants: few
                    restrictions, few complaints, block structures, stand-alone functions, and a compact
                    set of keywords. By using C, you can nearly achieve the efficiency of assembly code
                    combined with the structure of ALGOL or Modula-2. It's no wonder that C and C++
                    are easily the most popular languages among topflight professional programmers.
                    The fact that you can often use C in place of assembly language is a major factor in
                    its popularity among programmers. Assembly language uses a symbolic representation
                    of the actual binary code that the computer executes directly. Each assembly-language
                    operation maps into a single task for the computer to perform. Although assembly
                    language gives programmers the potential to accomplish tasks with maximum
                    flexibility and efficiency, it is notoriously difficult to work with when developing and
                    debugging a program. Furthermore, since assembly language is unstructured, the final
                    program tends to be spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled mess of jumps, calls, and indexes. This
                    lack of structure makes assembly-language programs difficult to read, enhance, and
                    maintain. Perhaps more important, assembly-language routines are not portable
                    between machines with different central processing units (CPUs).
                    Initially,C was used for systems programming. A systems program forms a portion
                    of the operating system of the computer or its support utilities. For example, the
                    following are usually called systems programs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating systems</li>
                    <li>Interpreters</li>
                    <li>Editors</li>
                    <li>File utilities</li>
                    <li>Performance enhancers</li>
                    <li>Real-time executives</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As C grew in popularity, many programmers began to use it to program all tasks
                    because of its portability and efficiencyâ€”and because they liked it! At the time of its
                    creation, C was a much longed-for, dramatic improvement in programming languages.
                    Of course, C++ has carried on this tradition.
                    With the advent of C++, some thought that C as a distinct language would die
                    out. Such has not been the case. First, not all programs require the application of the
                    object-oriented programming features provided by C++. For example, applications
                    such as embedded systems are still typically programmed in C. Second, much of the
                    world still runs on C code, and those programs will continue to be enhanced and
                    maintained. While C's greatest legacy is as the foundation for C++, it will continue to
                    be a vibrant, widely used language for many years to come.</p>

                    five were added by the ANSI C committee: enum, const, signed, void, and volatile.

                <p>In addition, many compilers have added several keywords that better exploit their
                    operating environment. For example, several compilers include keywords to manage
                    the memory organization of the 8086 family of processors, to support inter-language
                    programming, and to access interrupts. Here is a list of some commonly used extended
                    keywords:</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>asm</td>

                </table>

                <p>Your compiler may also support other extensions that help it take better advantage
                    of its specific environment.
                    All C (and C++) keywords are lowercase. Also, uppercase and lowercase are
                    different: else is a keyword; ELSE is not. You may not use a keyword for any other
                    purpose in a programâ€”that is, you may not use it as a variable or function name.
                    All C programs consist of one or more functions. The only function that must be
                    present is called main() , which is the first function called when program execution
                    begins. In well-written C code, main() contains what is, in essence, an outline of what
                    the program does. The outline is composed of function calls. Although main() is not
                    a keyword, treat it as if it were. For example, don't try to use main() as the name of a
                    variable because you will probably confuse the compiler.
                    The general form of a C program is illustrated in Figure 1-1, where f1() through
                    fN() represent user-defined functions.</p>

                <h2>The Library and Linking</h2>
                <p>Technically speaking, you can create a useful, functional C or C++ program that
                    consists solely of the statements that you actually created. However, this is quite
                    rare because neither C nor C++ provides any keywords that perform such things as
                    input/output (I/O) operations, high-level mathematical computations, or character
                    handling. As a result, most programs include calls to various functions contained in
                    the standard library.
                    All C++ compilers come with a standard library of functions that perform most
                    commonly needed tasks. Standard C++ specifies a minimal set of functions that will be
                    supported by all compilers. However, your compiler will probably contain many other
                    functions. For example, the standard library does not define any graphics functions,
                    but your compiler will probably include some.
                    The C++ standard library can be divided into two halves: the standard function
                    library and the class library. The standard function library is inherited from the C
                    language. C++ supports the entire function library defined by Standard C. Thus, all
                    of the standard C functions are available for use in C++ programs that you write.</p>

                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        global declarations <br>
                        return-type main(parameter list) <br>
                        { <br>
                        statement sequence <br>
                        } <br>
                        return-type f1(parameter list) <br>
                        { <br>
                        statement sequence <br>
                        } <br>
                        return-type f2(parameter list) <br>
                        { <br>
                        statement sequence <br>
                        } <br>

                        . <br>
                        return-type fN(parameter list) <br>
                        { <br>
                        statement sequence <br>
                        } <br>
                    </code>

                </div>

                <p>In addition to the standard function library, C++ also defines its own class library.
                    The class library provides object-oriented routines that your programs may use. It also
                    defines the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers off-the-shelf solutions to a
                    variety of programming problems. However, both the class library and the STL are
                    discussed later in this book. In Part One, only the standard function library is used,
                    since it is the only one that is also defined by C.
                    The implementors of your compiler have already written most of the generalpurpose
                    functions that you will use. When you call a function that is not part of your
                    program, the compiler "remembers" its name. Later, the linker combines the code you wrote with the
                    object code already found in the standard library. This process is called
                    linking. Some compilers have their own linker, while others use the standard linker
                    supplied by the operating system.
                    The functions in the library are in relocatable format. This means that the memory
                    addresses for the various machine-code instructions have not been absolutely
                    definedâ€”only offset information has been kept. When your program links with the
                    functions in the standard library, these memory offsets are used to create the actual
                    addresses used. There are several technical manuals and books that explain this
                    process in more detail. However, you do not need any further explanation of the
                    relocation process to program in C++.
                    Many of the functions that you will need as you write programs are in the standard
                    library. They act as building blocks that you combine. If you write a function that you
                    will use again and again, you can place it into a library, too.</p>

                <h2>Separate Compilation</h2>
                <p>Most short programs are completely contained within one source file. However, as a
                    program's length grows, so does its compile time (and long compile times make for
                    short tempers). Hence, C/C++ allows a program to be contained in many files and lets
                    you compile each file separately. Once you have compiled all files, they are linked,
                    along with any library routines, to form the complete object code. The advantage of
                    separate compilation is that if you change the code of one file, you do not need to
                    recompile the entire program. On all but the simplest projects, this saves a substantial
                    amount of time. The user documentation to your C/C++ compiler will contain
                    instructions for compiling multifile programs.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the .C and .CPP File Extensions</h2>
                <p>The programs in Part One of this book are, of course, valid C++ programs and can be
                    compiled using any modern C++ compiler. They are also valid C programs and can be
                    compiled using a C compiler. Thus, if you are called upon to write C programs, the
                    ones shown in Part One qualify as examples. Traditionally, C programs use the file
                    extension .C, and C++ programs use the extension .CPP. A C++ compiler uses the file
                    extension to determine what type of program it is compiling. This is important because
                    the compiler assumes that any program using the .C extension is a C program and that
                    any file using .CPP is a C++ program. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, you may use
                    either extension for the programs in Part One. However, the programs in the rest of
                    this book will require .CPP.
                    One last point: Although C is a subset of C++, there are a few minor differences
                    between the two languages, and in a few cases, you may need to compile a C program
                    as a C program (using the .C extension). Any instances of this will be noted.</p>

                    <h1>Introduction 3</h1>
                    <p>To understand C++ is to understand the forces that drove its creation, the ideas
                        that shaped it, and the legacy it inherits. Thus, the story of C++ begins with C.
                        This chapter presents an overview of the C programming language, its origins, its
                        uses, and its underlying philosophy. Since C++ is built upon C, this chapter provides
                        an important historical perspective on the roots of C++. Much of what makes C++
                        what it is had its genesis in the C language.</p>
                    <h2>The origin of C</h2>
                    <p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                        the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an
                        older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                        influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the
                        development of C in the 1970s.
                        For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the Unix
                        version 5 operating system. It was first described in The C Programming Language by
                        Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978). In the
                        summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an ANSI (American National
                        Standards Institute) standard that would define the C language once and for all. The
                        standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                        The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
                        becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (International
                        Standards Organization) and is now referred to as the ANSI/ISO C standard. For
                        simplicity, this book will use the term Standard C when referring to the ANSI/ISO C
                        standard. Today, all mainstream C/C++ compilers comply with Standard C. Standard
                        C is the foundation upon which C++ is built.</p>
                    <h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
                    <p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less
                        powerful, harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC
                        or Pascal, nor does it imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language
                        (and its associated troubles). Rather, C is thought of as a middle-level language because
                        it combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and flexibilityof
                        assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the spectrum of computer
                        languages.
                        As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and
                        addressesâ€”the basic elements with which the computer functions. Despite this fact
                        C code is also very portable. Portability means that it is easy to adapt software written
                        for one type of computer or operating system to another. For example, if you can easily
                        convert a program written for DOS so that it runs under Windows, that program is
                        portable.
                        All high-level programming languages support the concept of data types. A data
                        type defines a set of values that a variable can store along with a set of operations that
                        can be performed on that variable. Common data types are integer, character, and real.
                        Although C has five basic built-in data types, it is not a strongly typed language, as are
                        Pascal and Ada. C permits almost all type conversions. For example, you may freely
                        intermix character and integer types in an expression.
                        Unlike a high-level language, C performs almost no run-time error checking. For
                        example, no check is performed to ensure that array boundaries are not overrun. These
                        types of checks are the responsibility of the programmer.
                        In the same vein, C does not demand strict type compatibility between a parameter
                        and an argument. As you may know from your other programming experience, a
                        high-level computer language will typically require that the type of an argument be
                        (more or less) exactly the same type as the parameter that will receive the argument.
                        However, such is not the case for C. Instead, C allows an argument to be of any type
                        as long as it can be reasonably converted into the type of the parameter. Further, C
                        provides all of the automatic conversions to accomplish this.
                        C is special in that it allows the direct manipulation of bits, bytes, words, and
                        pointers. This makes it well suited for system-level programming, where these
                        operations are common.
                        Another important aspect of C is that it has only 32 keywords (27 from the
                        Kernighan and Ritchie de facto standard, and five added by the ANSI standardization
                        committee), which are the commands that make up the C language. High-level
                        languages typically have several times more keywords. As a comparison, consider
                        that most versions of BASIC have well over 100 keywords!</p>
                    <h2>C Is a Structured Language</h2>
                    <p>In your previous programming experience, you may have heard the term blockstructured
                        applied to a computer language. Although the term block-structured
                        language does not strictly apply to C, C is commonly referred to simply as a
                        structured language. It has many similarities to other structured languages, such
                        as ALGOL, Pascal, and Modula-2.
                        The reason that C (and C++) is not, technically, a block-structured language is that
                        block-structured languages permit procedures or functions to be declared inside
                        other procedures or functions. Since C does not allow the creation of functions
                        within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.
                        The distinguishing feature of a structured language is compartmentalization of code
                        and data. This is the ability of a language to section off and hide from the rest of the
                        program all information and instructions necessary to perform a specific task. One
                        way that you achieve compartmentalization is by using subroutines that employ local
                        (temporary) variables. By using local variables, you can write subroutines so that the
                        events that occur within them cause no side effects in other parts of the program. This
                        capability makes it very easy for programs to share sections of code. If you develop
                        compartmentalized functions, you only need to know what a function does, not how it
                        does it. Remember, excessive use of global variables (variables known throughout the
                        entire program) may allow bugs to creep into a program by allowing unwanted side
                        effects. (Anyone who has programmed in standard BASIC is well aware of this
                        problem.)
                        The concept of compartmentalization is greatly expanded by C++. Specifically, in
                        C++, one part of your program may tightly control which other parts of your
                        program are allowed access.
                        A structured language allows you a variety of programming possibilities. It
                        directly supports several loop constructs, such as while, do-while, and for. In a
                        structured language, the use of goto is either prohibited or discouraged and is not the
                        common form of program control (as is the case in standard BASIC and traditional FORTRAN, for
                        example).
                        A structured language allows you to place statements
                        anywhere on a line and does not require a strict field concept (as some older
                        FORTRANs do).
                        Here are some examples of structured and nonstructured languages:</p>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; justify: space-between;">
                        <div style="margin-right: 5%;">
                            <ul>Nonstructured: </ul>
                            <li>FORTRAN</li>
                            <li>BASIC</li>
                            <li>COBOL</li>
                        </div>
                        <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                            <ul>Structured: </ul>
                            <li>Pascal</li>
                            <li>Ada</li>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>C++</li>
                            <li>C</li>
                            <li>Modula-2</li>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Structured languages tend to be modern. In fact, a mark of an old computer
                        language is that it is nonstructured. Today, few programmers would consider using
                        a nonstructured language for serious, new programs.
                        New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.
                        BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings of these languages can never be
                        fully mitigated because they were not designed with structured features from the
                        beginning.
                        C's main structural component is the functionâ€”C's stand-alone subroutine. In
                        C, functions are the building blocks in which all program activity occurs. They let
                        you define and code separately the separate tasks in a program, thus allowing your
                        programs to be modular. After you have created a function, you can rely on it to
                        work properly in various situations without creating side effects in other parts of
                        the program. Being able to create stand-alone functions is extremely critical in larger
                        projects where one programmer's code must not accidentally affect another's.
                        Another way to structure and compartmentalize code in C is through the use of
                        code blocks. A code block is a logically connected group of program statements that is
                        treated as a unit. In C, you create a code block by placing a sequence of statements
                        between opening and closing curly braces. In this example,</p>
                    <div class="code"">
        
                        <code>
                                if (x < 10) { <br>
                                    printf(" Too low, try again.\n"); <br>
                        scanf("%d", &x); <br>
                        } <br>
                        </code>
                    </div>
                    <p>the two statements after the if and between the curly braces are both executed if x is
                        less than 10. These two statements together with the braces represent a code block.
                        They are a logical unit: One of the statements cannot execute without the other
                        executing also. Code blocks allow many algorithms to be implemented with clarity,
                        elegance, and efficiency. Moreover, they help the programmer better conceptualize
                        the true nature of the algorithm being implemented.</p>

                    <h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
                    <p>the classic examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was
                        designed not to better the programmer's lot, nor to improve the reliability of the code
                        produced, nor even to improve the speed with which code can be written. Rather,
                        COBOL was designed, in part, to enable nonprogrammers to read and presumably
                        (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was created essentially to allow
                        nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple problems.
                        In contrast, C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers.
                        The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants: few
                        restrictions, few complaints, block structures, stand-alone functions, and a compact
                        set of keywords. By using C, you can nearly achieve the efficiency of assembly code
                        combined with the structure of ALGOL or Modula-2. It's no wonder that C and C++
                        are easily the most popular languages among topflight professional programmers.
                        The fact that you can often use C in place of assembly language is a major factor in
                        its popularity among programmers. Assembly language uses a symbolic representation
                        of the actual binary code that the computer executes directly. Each assembly-language
                        operation maps into a single task for the computer to perform. Although assembly
                        language gives programmers the potential to accomplish tasks with maximum
                        flexibility and efficiency, it is notoriously difficult to work with when developing and
                        debugging a program. Furthermore, since assembly language is unstructured, the final
                        program tends to be spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled mess of jumps, calls, and indexes. This
                        lack of structure makes assembly-language programs difficult to read, enhance, and
                        maintain. Perhaps more important, assembly-language routines are not portable
                        between machines with different central processing units (CPUs).
                        Initially,C was used for systems programming. A systems program forms a portion
                        of the operating system of the computer or its support utilities. For example, the
                        following are usually called systems programs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Operating systems</li>
                        <li>Interpreters</li>
                        <li>Editors</li>
                        <li>File utilities</li>
                        <li>Performance enhancers</li>
                        <li>Real-time executives</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As C grew in popularity, many programmers began to use it to program all tasks
                        because of its portability and efficiencyâ€”and because they liked it! At the time of its
                        creation, C was a much longed-for, dramatic improvement in programming languages.
                        Of course, C++ has carried on this tradition.
                        With the advent of C++, some thought that C as a distinct language would die
                        out. Such has not been the case. First, not all programs require the application of the
                        object-oriented programming features provided by C++. For example, applications
                        such as embedded systems are still typically programmed in C. Second, much of the
                        world still runs on C code, and those programs will continue to be enhanced and
                        maintained. While C's greatest legacy is as the foundation for C++, it will continue to
                        be a vibrant, widely used language for many years to come.</p>

                    <p>In addition, many compilers have added several keywords that better exploit their
                        operating environment. For example, several compilers include keywords to manage
                        the memory organization of the 8086 family of processors, to support inter-language
                        programming, and to access interrupts. Here is a list of some commonly used extended
                        keywords:</p>

                    </table>

                    <p>Your compiler may also support other extensions that help it take better advantage
                        of its specific environment.
                        All C (and C++) keywords are lowercase. Also, uppercase and lowercase are
                        different: else is a keyword; ELSE is not. You may not use a keyword for any other
                        purpose in a programâ€”that is, you may not use it as a variable or function name.
                        All C programs consist of one or more functions. The only function that must be
                        present is called main() , which is the first function called when program execution
                        begins. In well-written C code, main() contains what is, in essence, an outline of what
                        the program does. The outline is composed of function calls. Although main() is not
                        a keyword, treat it as if it were. For example, don't try to use main() as the name of a
                        variable because you will probably confuse the compiler.
                        The general form of a C program is illustrated in Figure 1-1, where f1() through
                        fN() represent user-defined functions.</p>

                    <h2>The Library and Linking</h2>
                    <p>Technically speaking, you can create a useful, functional C or C++ program that
                        consists solely of the statements that you actually created. However, this is quite
                        rare because neither C nor C++ provides any keywords that perform such things as
                        input/output (I/O) operations, high-level mathematical computations, or character
                        handling. As a result, most programs include calls to various functions contained in
                        the standard library.
                        All C++ compilers come with a standard library of functions that perform most
                        commonly needed tasks. Standard C++ specifies a minimal set of functions that will be
                        supported by all compilers. However, your compiler will probably contain many other
                        functions. For example, the standard library does not define any graphics functions,
                        but your compiler will probably include some.
                        The C++ standard library can be divided into two halves: the standard function
                        library and the class library. The standard function library is inherited from the C
                        language. C++ supports the entire function library defined by Standard C. Thus, all
                        of the standard C functions are available for use in C++ programs that you write.</p>

                    <div class="code">
                        <code>
                            global declarations <br>

                    </div>

                    <p>In addition to the standard function library, C++ also defines its own class library.
                        The class library provides object-oriented routines that your programs may use. It also
                        defines the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers off-the-shelf solutions to a
                        variety of programming problems. However, both the class library and the STL are
                        discussed later in this book. In Part One, only the standard function library is used,
                        since it is the only one that is also defined by C.
                        The implementors of your compiler have already written most of the generalpurpose
                        functions that you will use. When you call a function that is not part of your
                        program, the compiler "remembers" its name. Later, the linker combines the code you wrote with
                        the
                        object code already found in the standard library. This process is called
                        linking. Some compilers have their own linker, while others use the standard linker
                        supplied by the operating system.
                        The functions in the library are in relocatable format. This means that the memory
                        addresses for the various machine-code instructions have not been absolutely
                        definedâ€”only offset information has been kept. When your program links with the
                        functions in the standard library, these memory offsets are used to create the actual
                        addresses used. There are several technical manuals and books that explain this
                        process in more detail. However, you do not need any further explanation of the
                        relocation process to program in C++.
                        Many of the functions that you will need as you write programs are in the standard
                        library. They act as building blocks that you combine. If you write a function that you
                        will use again and again, you can place it into a library, too.</p>

                    <h2>Separate Compilation</h2>
                    <p>Most short programs are completely contained within one source file. However, as a
                        program's length grows, so does its compile time (and long compile times make for
                        short tempers). Hence, C/C++ allows a program to be contained in many files and lets
                        you compile each file separately. Once you have compiled all files, they are linked,
                        along with any library routines, to form the complete object code. The advantage of
                        separate compilation is that if you change the code of one file, you do not need to
                        recompile the entire program. On all but the simplest projects, this saves a substantial
                        amount of time. The user documentation to your C/C++ compiler will contain
                        instructions for compiling multifile programs.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding the .C and .CPP File Extensions</h2>
                    <p>The programs in Part One of this book are, of course, valid C++ programs and can be
                        compiled using any modern C++ compiler. They are also valid C programs and can be
                        compiled using a C compiler. Thus, if you are called upon to write C programs, the
                        ones shown in Part One qualify as examples. Traditionally, C programs use the file
                        extension .C, and C++ programs use the extension .CPP. A C++ compiler uses the file
                        extension to determine what type of program it is compiling. This is important because
                        the compiler assumes that any program using the .C extension is a C program and that
                        any file using .CPP is a C++ program. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, you may use
                        either extension for the programs in Part One. However, the programs in the rest of
                        this book will require .CPP.
                        One last point: Although C is a subset of C++, there are a few minor differences
                        between the two languages, and in a few cases, you may need to compile a C program
                        as a C program (using the .C extension). Any instances of this will be noted.</p>

                    <section id="introduction4" class="main-section">
                        <h1>Introduction 4</h1>
                        <p>To understand C++ is to understand the forces that drove its creation, the ideas
                            that shaped it, and the legacy it inherits. Thus, the story of C++ begins with C.
                            This chapter presents an overview of the C programming language, its origins, its
                            uses, and its underlying philosophy. Since C++ is built upon C, this chapter provides
                            an important historical perspective on the roots of C++. Much of what makes C++
                            what it is had its genesis in the C language.</p>
                        <h2>The origin of C</h2>
                        <p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                            the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an
                            older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                            influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the
                            development of C in the 1970s.
                            For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the Unix
                            version 5 operating system. It was first described in The C Programming Language by
                            Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978). In the
                            summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an ANSI (American National
                            Standards Institute) standard that would define the C language once and for all. The
                            standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                            The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
                            becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (International
                            Standards Organization) and is now referred to as the ANSI/ISO C standard. For
                            simplicity, this book will use the term Standard C when referring to the ANSI/ISO C
                            standard. Today, all mainstream C/C++ compilers comply with Standard C. Standard
                            C is the foundation upon which C++ is built.</p>
                        <h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
                        <p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less
                            powerful, harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC
                            or Pascal, nor does it imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language
                            (and its associated troubles). Rather, C is thought of as a middle-level language because
                            it combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and flexibilityof
                            assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the spectrum of computer
                            languages.
                            As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and
                            addressesâ€”the basic elements with which the computer functions. Despite this fact
                            C code is also very portable. Portability means that it is easy to adapt software written
                            for one type of computer or operating system to another. For example, if you can easily
                            convert a program written for DOS so that it runs under Windows, that program is
                            portable.
                            All high-level programming languages support the concept of data types. A data
                            type defines a set of values that a variable can store along with a set of operations that
                            can be performed on that variable. Common data types are integer, character, and real.
                            Although C has five basic built-in data types, it is not a strongly typed language, as are
                            Pascal and Ada. C permits almost all type conversions. For example, you may freely
                            intermix character and integer types in an expression.
                            Unlike a high-level language, C performs almost no run-time error checking. For
                            example, no check is performed to ensure that array boundaries are not overrun. These
                            types of checks are the responsibility of the programmer.
                            In the same vein, C does not demand strict type compatibility between a parameter
                            and an argument. As you may know from your other programming experience, a
                            high-level computer language will typically require that the type of an argument be
                            (more or less) exactly the same type as the parameter that will receive the argument.
                            However, such is not the case for C. Instead, C allows an argument to be of any type
                            as long as it can be reasonably converted into the type of the parameter. Further, C
                            provides all of the automatic conversions to accomplish this.
                            C is special in that it allows the direct manipulation of bits, bytes, words, and
                            pointers. This makes it well suited for system-level programming, where these
                            operations are common.
                            Another important aspect of C is that it has only 32 keywords (27 from the
                            Kernighan and Ritchie de facto standard, and five added by the ANSI standardization
                            committee), which are the commands that make up the C language. High-level
                            languages typically have several times more keywords. As a comparison, consider
                            that most versions of BASIC have well over 100 keywords!</p>
                        <h2>C Is a Structured Language</h2>
                        <p>In your previous programming experience, you may have heard the term blockstructured
                            applied to a computer language. Although the term block-structured
                            language does not strictly apply to C, C is commonly referred to simply as a
                            structured language. It has many similarities to other structured languages, such
                            as ALGOL, Pascal, and Modula-2.
                            The reason that C (and C++) is not, technically, a block-structured language is that
                            block-structured languages permit procedures or functions to be declared inside
                            other procedures or functions. Since C does not allow the creation of functions
                            within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.
                            The distinguishing feature of a structured language is compartmentalization of code
                            and data. This is the ability of a language to section off and hide from the rest of the
                            program all information and instructions necessary to perform a specific task. One
                            way that you achieve compartmentalization is by using subroutines that employ local
                            (temporary) variables. By using local variables, you can write subroutines so that the
                            events that occur within them cause no side effects in other parts of the program. This
                            capability makes it very easy for programs to share sections of code. If you develop
                            compartmentalized functions, you only need to know what a function does, not how it
                            does it. Remember, excessive use of global variables (variables known throughout the
                            entire program) may allow bugs to creep into a program by allowing unwanted side
                            effects. (Anyone who has programmed in standard BASIC is well aware of this
                            problem.)
                            The concept of compartmentalization is greatly expanded by C++. Specifically, in
                            C++, one part of your program may tightly control which other parts of your
                            program are allowed access.
                            A structured language allows you a variety of programming possibilities. It
                            directly supports several loop constructs, such as while, do-while, and for. In a
                            structured language, the use of goto is either prohibited or discouraged and is not the
                            common form of program control (as is the case in standard BASIC and traditional FORTRAN,
                            for example).
                            A structured language allows you to place statements
                            anywhere on a line and does not require a strict field concept (as some older
                            FORTRANs do).
                            Here are some examples of structured and nonstructured languages:</p>
                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; justify: space-between;">
                            <div style="margin-right: 5%;">
                                <ul>Nonstructured: </ul>
                                <li>FORTRAN</li>
                                <li>BASIC</li>
                                <li>COBOL</li>
                            </div>
                            <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                                <ul>Structured: </ul>
                                <li>Pascal</li>
                                <li>Ada</li>
                                <li>Java</li>
                                <li>C++</li>
                                <li>C</li>
                                <li>Modula-2</li>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Structured languages tend to be modern. In fact, a mark of an old computer
                            language is that it is nonstructured. Today, few programmers would consider using
                            a nonstructured language for serious, new programs.
                            New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.
                            BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings of these languages can never be
                            fully mitigated because they were not designed with structured features from the
                            beginning.
                            C's main structural component is the functionâ€”C's stand-alone subroutine. In
                            C, functions are the building blocks in which all program activity occurs. They let
                            you define and code separately the separate tasks in a program, thus allowing your
                            programs to be modular. After you have created a function, you can rely on it to
                            work properly in various situations without creating side effects in other parts of
                            the program. Being able to create stand-alone functions is extremely critical in larger
                            projects where one programmer's code must not accidentally affect another's.
                            Another way to structure and compartmentalize code in C is through the use of
                            code blocks. A code block is a logically connected group of program statements that is
                            treated as a unit. In C, you create a code block by placing a sequence of statements
                            between opening and closing curly braces. In this example,</p>
                        <div class="code"">
            
                            <code>
                                    if (x < 10) { <br>
                                        printf(" Too low, try again.\n"); <br>
                            scanf("%d", &x); <br>
                            } <br>
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>the two statements after the if and between the curly braces are both executed if x is
                            less than 10. These two statements together with the braces represent a code block.
                            They are a logical unit: One of the statements cannot execute without the other
                            executing also. Code blocks allow many algorithms to be implemented with clarity,
                            elegance, and efficiency. Moreover, they help the programmer better conceptualize
                            the true nature of the algorithm being implemented.</p>

                        <h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
                        <p>the classic examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was
                            designed not to better the programmer's lot, nor to improve the reliability of the code
                            produced, nor even to improve the speed with which code can be written. Rather,
                            COBOL was designed, in part, to enable nonprogrammers to read and presumably
                            (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was created essentially to allow
                            nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple problems.
                            In contrast, C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers.
                            The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants: few
                            restrictions, few complaints, block structures, stand-alone functions, and a compact
                            set of keywords. By using C, you can nearly achieve the efficiency of assembly code
                            combined with the structure of ALGOL or Modula-2. It's no wonder that C and C++
                            are easily the most popular languages among topflight professional programmers.
                            The fact that you can often use C in place of assembly language is a major factor in
                            its popularity among programmers. Assembly language uses a symbolic representation
                            of the actual binary code that the computer executes directly. Each assembly-language
                            operation maps into a single task for the computer to perform. Although assembly
                            language gives programmers the potential to accomplish tasks with maximum
                            flexibility and efficiency, it is notoriously difficult to work with when developing and
                            debugging a program. Furthermore, since assembly language is unstructured, the final
                            program tends to be spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled mess of jumps, calls, and indexes. This
                            lack of structure makes assembly-language programs difficult to read, enhance, and
                            maintain. Perhaps more important, assembly-language routines are not portable
                            between machines with different central processing units (CPUs).
                            Initially,C was used for systems programming. A systems program forms a portion
                            of the operating system of the computer or its support utilities. For example, the
                            following are usually called systems programs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Operating systems</li>
                            <li>Interpreters</li>
                            <li>Editors</li>
                            <li>File utilities</li>
                            <li>Performance enhancers</li>
                            <li>Real-time executives</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>As C grew in popularity, many programmers began to use it to program all tasks
                            because of its portability and efficiencyâ€”and because they liked it! At the time of its
                            creation, C was a much longed-for, dramatic improvement in programming languages.
                            Of course, C++ has carried on this tradition.
                            With the advent of C++, some thought that C as a distinct language would die
                            out. Such has not been the case. First, not all programs require the application of the
                            object-oriented programming features provided by C++. For example, applications
                            such as embedded systems are still typically programmed in C. Second, much of the
                            world still runs on C code, and those programs will continue to be enhanced and
                            maintained. While C's greatest legacy is as the foundation for C++, it will continue to
                            be a vibrant, widely used language for many years to come.</p>

                            operating environment. For example, several compilers include keywords to manage
                            the memory organization of the 8086 family of processors, to support inter-language
                            programming, and to access interrupts. Here is a list of some commonly used extended

                            different: else is a keyword; ELSE is not. You may not use a keyword for any other
                            purpose in a programâ€”that is, you may not use it as a variable or function name.
                            All C programs consist of one or more functions. The only function that must be
                            present is called main() , which is the first function called when program execution
                            begins. In well-written C code, main() contains what is, in essence, an outline of what
                            the program does. The outline is composed of function calls. Although main() is not
                            a keyword, treat it as if it were. For example, don't try to use main() as the name of a
                            variable because you will probably confuse the compiler.
                            The general form of a C program is illustrated in Figure 1-1, where f1() through
                            fN() represent user-defined functions.</p>

                        <h2>The Library and Linking</h2>
                        <p>Technically speaking, you can create a useful, functional C or C++ program that
                            consists solely of the statements that you actually created. However, this is quite
                            rare because neither C nor C++ provides any keywords that perform such things as
                            input/output (I/O) operations, high-level mathematical computations, or character
                            handling. As a result, most programs include calls to various functions contained in
                            the standard library.
                            All C++ compilers come with a standard library of functions that perform most
                            commonly needed tasks. Standard C++ specifies a minimal set of functions that will be
                            supported by all compilers. However, your compiler will probably contain many other
                            functions. For example, the standard library does not define any graphics functions,
                            but your compiler will probably include some.
                            The C++ standard library can be divided into two halves: the standard function
                            library and the class library. The standard function library is inherited from the C
                            language. C++ supports the entire function library defined by Standard C. Thus, all
                            of the standard C functions are available for use in C++ programs that you write.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the standard function library, C++ also defines its own class library.
                            The class library provides object-oriented routines that your programs may use. It also
                            defines the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers off-the-shelf solutions to a
                            variety of programming problems. However, both the class library and the STL are
                            discussed later in this book. In Part One, only the standard function library is used,
                            since it is the only one that is also defined by C.
                            The implementors of your compiler have already written most of the generalpurpose
                            functions that you will use. When you call a function that is not part of your
                            program, the compiler "remembers" its name. Later, the linker combines the code you wrote
                            with the
                            object code already found in the standard library. This process is called
                            linking. Some compilers have their own linker, while others use the standard linker
                            supplied by the operating system.
                            The functions in the library are in relocatable format. This means that the memory
                            addresses for the various machine-code instructions have not been absolutely
                            definedâ€”only offset information has been kept. When your program links with the
                            functions in the standard library, these memory offsets are used to create the actual
                            addresses used. There are several technical manuals and books that explain this
                            process in more detail. However, you do not need any further explanation of the
                            relocation process to program in C++.
                            Many of the functions that you will need as you write programs are in the standard
                            library. They act as building blocks that you combine. If you write a function that you
                            will use again and again, you can place it into a library, too.</p>

                        <h2>Separate Compilation</h2>
                        <p>Most short programs are completely contained within one source file. However, as a
                            program's length grows, so does its compile time (and long compile times make for
                            short tempers). Hence, C/C++ allows a program to be contained in many files and lets
                            you compile each file separately. Once you have compiled all files, they are linked,
                            along with any library routines, to form the complete object code. The advantage of
                            separate compilation is that if you change the code of one file, you do not need to
                            recompile the entire program. On all but the simplest projects, this saves a substantial
                            amount of time. The user documentation to your C/C++ compiler will contain
                            instructions for compiling multifile programs.</p>

                        <h2>Understanding the .C and .CPP File Extensions</h2>
                        <p>The programs in Part One of this book are, of course, valid C++ programs and can be
                            compiled using any modern C++ compiler. They are also valid C programs and can be
                            compiled using a C compiler. Thus, if you are called upon to write C programs, the
                            ones shown in Part One qualify as examples. Traditionally, C programs use the file
                            extension .C, and C++ programs use the extension .CPP. A C++ compiler uses the file
                            extension to determine what type of program it is compiling. This is important because
                            the compiler assumes that any program using the .C extension is a C program and that
                            any file using .CPP is a C++ program. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, you may use
                            either extension for the programs in Part One. However, the programs in the rest of
                            this book will require .CPP.
                            One last point: Although C is a subset of C++, there are a few minor differences
                            between the two languages, and in a few cases, you may need to compile a C program
                            as a C program (using the .C extension). Any instances of this will be noted.</p>

                            <h1>Introduction 5</h1>
                            <p>To understand C++ is to understand the forces that drove its creation, the ideas
                                that shaped it, and the legacy it inherits. Thus, the story of C++ begins with C.
                                This chapter presents an overview of the C programming language, its origins, its
                                uses, and its underlying philosophy. Since C++ is built upon C, this chapter provides
                                an important historical perspective on the roots of C++. Much of what makes C++
                                what it is had its genesis in the C language.</p>
                            <h2>The origin of C</h2>
                            <p>C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used
                                the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an
                                older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it
                                influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the
                                development of C in the 1970s.
                                For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the Unix
                                version 5 operating system. It was first described in The C Programming Language by
                                Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1978). In the
                                summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an ANSI (American National
                                Standards Institute) standard that would define the C language once and for all. The
                                standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                                The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies
                                becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (International
                                Standards Organization) and is now referred to as the ANSI/ISO C standard. For
                                simplicity, this book will use the term Standard C when referring to the ANSI/ISO C
                                standard. Today, all mainstream C/C++ compilers comply with Standard C. Standard
                                C is the foundation upon which C++ is built.</p>
                            <h2>C Is a Middle-Level Language</h2>
                            <p>C is often called a middle-level computer language. This does not mean that C is less
                                powerful, harder to use, or less developed than a high-level language such as BASIC
                                or Pascal, nor does it imply that C has the cumbersome nature of assembly language
                                (and its associated troubles). Rather, C is thought of as a middle-level language
                                because
                                it combines the best elements of high-level languages with the control and flexibilityof
                                assembly language. Table 1-1 shows how C fits into the spectrum of computer
                                languages.
                                As a middle-level language, C allows the manipulation of bits, bytes, and
                                addressesâ€”the basic elements with which the computer functions. Despite this fact
                                C code is also very portable. Portability means that it is easy to adapt software
                                written
                                for one type of computer or operating system to another. For example, if you can easily
                                convert a program written for DOS so that it runs under Windows, that program is
                                portable.
                                All high-level programming languages support the concept of data types. A data
                                type defines a set of values that a variable can store along with a set of operations
                                that
                                can be performed on that variable. Common data types are integer, character, and real.
                                Although C has five basic built-in data types, it is not a strongly typed language, as
                                are
                                Pascal and Ada. C permits almost all type conversions. For example, you may freely
                                intermix character and integer types in an expression.
                                Unlike a high-level language, C performs almost no run-time error checking. For
                                example, no check is performed to ensure that array boundaries are not overrun. These
                                types of checks are the responsibility of the programmer.
                                In the same vein, C does not demand strict type compatibility between a parameter
                                and an argument. As you may know from your other programming experience, a
                                high-level computer language will typically require that the type of an argument be
                                (more or less) exactly the same type as the parameter that will receive the argument.
                                However, such is not the case for C. Instead, C allows an argument to be of any type
                                as long as it can be reasonably converted into the type of the parameter. Further, C
                                provides all of the automatic conversions to accomplish this.
                                C is special in that it allows the direct manipulation of bits, bytes, words, and
                                pointers. This makes it well suited for system-level programming, where these
                                operations are common.
                                Another important aspect of C is that it has only 32 keywords (27 from the
                                Kernighan and Ritchie de facto standard, and five added by the ANSI standardization
                                committee), which are the commands that make up the C language. High-level
                                languages typically have several times more keywords. As a comparison, consider
                                that most versions of BASIC have well over 100 keywords!</p>
                            <h2>C Is a Structured Language</h2>
                            <p>In your previous programming experience, you may have heard the term blockstructured
                                applied to a computer language. Although the term block-structured
                                language does not strictly apply to C, C is commonly referred to simply as a
                                structured language. It has many similarities to other structured languages, such
                                as ALGOL, Pascal, and Modula-2.
                                The reason that C (and C++) is not, technically, a block-structured language is that
                                block-structured languages permit procedures or functions to be declared inside
                                other procedures or functions. Since C does not allow the creation of functions
                                within functions, it cannot formally be called block-structured.
                                The distinguishing feature of a structured language is compartmentalization of code
                                and data. This is the ability of a language to section off and hide from the rest of the
                                program all information and instructions necessary to perform a specific task. One
                                way that you achieve compartmentalization is by using subroutines that employ local
                                (temporary) variables. By using local variables, you can write subroutines so that the
                                events that occur within them cause no side effects in other parts of the program. This
                                capability makes it very easy for programs to share sections of code. If you develop
                                compartmentalized functions, you only need to know what a function does, not how it
                                does it. Remember, excessive use of global variables (variables known throughout the
                                entire program) may allow bugs to creep into a program by allowing unwanted side
                                effects. (Anyone who has programmed in standard BASIC is well aware of this
                                problem.)
                                The concept of compartmentalization is greatly expanded by C++. Specifically, in
                                C++, one part of your program may tightly control which other parts of your
                                program are allowed access.
                                A structured language allows you a variety of programming possibilities. It
                                directly supports several loop constructs, such as while, do-while, and for. In a
                                structured language, the use of goto is either prohibited or discouraged and is not the
                                common form of program control (as is the case in standard BASIC and traditional
                                FORTRAN, for example).
                                A structured language allows you to place statements
                                anywhere on a line and does not require a strict field concept (as some older
                                FORTRANs do).
                                Here are some examples of structured and nonstructured languages:</p>
                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; justify: space-between;">
                                <div style="margin-right: 5%;">
                                    <ul>Nonstructured: </ul>

                                    <li>BASIC</li>
                                    <li>COBOL</li>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-left: 5%;">
                                    <ul>Structured: </ul>
                                    <li>Pascal</li>
                                    <li>Ada</li>
                                    <li>Java</li>
                                    <li>C++</li>
                                    <li>C</li>
                                    <li>Modula-2</li>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>Structured languages tend to be modern. In fact, a mark of an old computer
                                language is that it is nonstructured. Today, few programmers would consider using
                                a nonstructured language for serious, new programs.
                                New versions of many older languages have attempted to add structured elements.
                                BASIC is an example. However, the shortcomings of these languages can never be
                                fully mitigated because they were not designed with structured features from the
                                beginning.
                                C's main structural component is the functionâ€”C's stand-alone subroutine. In
                                C, functions are the building blocks in which all program activity occurs. They let
                                you define and code separately the separate tasks in a program, thus allowing your
                                programs to be modular. After you have created a function, you can rely on it to
                                work properly in various situations without creating side effects in other parts of
                                the program. Being able to create stand-alone functions is extremely critical in larger
                                projects where one programmer's code must not accidentally affect another's.
                                Another way to structure and compartmentalize code in C is through the use of
                                code blocks. A code block is a logically connected group of program statements that is
                                treated as a unit. In C, you create a code block by placing a sequence of statements
                                between opening and closing curly braces. In this example,</p>
                            <div class="code"">
                
                                <code>
                                        if (x < 10) { <br>
                                            printf(" Too low, try again.\n"); <br>
                                scanf("%d", &x); <br>
                                } <br>
                                </code>
                            </div>
                            <p>the two statements after the if and between the curly braces are both executed if x is
                                less than 10. These two statements together with the braces represent a code block.
                                They are a logical unit: One of the statements cannot execute without the other
                                executing also. Code blocks allow many algorithms to be implemented with clarity,
                                elegance, and efficiency. Moreover, they help the programmer better conceptualize
                                the true nature of the algorithm being implemented.</p>

                            <h2>C Is a Programmer's Language</h2>
                            <p>the classic examples of nonprogrammer languages, COBOL and BASIC. COBOL was
                                designed not to better the programmer's lot, nor to improve the reliability of the code
                                produced, nor even to improve the speed with which code can be written. Rather,
                                COBOL was designed, in part, to enable nonprogrammers to read and presumably
                                (however unlikely) to understand the program. BASIC was created essentially to allow
                                nonprogrammers to program a computer to solve relatively simple problems.
                                In contrast, C was created, influenced, and field-tested by working programmers.
                                The end result is that C gives the programmer what the programmer wants: few
                                restrictions, few complaints, block structures, stand-alone functions, and a compact
                                set of keywords. By using C, you can nearly achieve the efficiency of assembly code
                                combined with the structure of ALGOL or Modula-2. It's no wonder that C and C++
                                are easily the most popular languages among topflight professional programmers.
                                The fact that you can often use C in place of assembly language is a major factor in
                                its popularity among programmers. Assembly language uses a symbolic representation
                                of the actual binary code that the computer executes directly. Each assembly-language
                                operation maps into a single task for the computer to perform. Although assembly
                                language gives programmers the potential to accomplish tasks with maximum
                                flexibility and efficiency, it is notoriously difficult to work with when developing and
                                debugging a program. Furthermore, since assembly language is unstructured, the final
                                program tends to be spaghetti codeâ€”a tangled mess of jumps, calls, and indexes. This
                                lack of structure makes assembly-language programs difficult to read, enhance, and
                                maintain. Perhaps more important, assembly-language routines are not portable
                                between machines with different central processing units (CPUs).
                                Initially,C was used for systems programming. A systems program forms a portion
                                of the operating system of the computer or its support utilities. For example, the
                                following are usually called systems programs:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Operating systems</li>
                                <li>Interpreters</li>
                                <li>Editors</li>
                                <li>File utilities</li>
                                <li>Performance enhancers</li>
                                <li>Real-time executives</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>As C grew in popularity, many programmers began to use it to program all tasks
                                because of its portability and efficiencyâ€”and because they liked it! At the time of its
                                creation, C was a much longed-for, dramatic improvement in programming languages.
                                Of course, C++ has carried on this tradition.
                                With the advent of C++, some thought that C as a distinct language would die
                                out. Such has not been the case. First, not all programs require the application of the
                                object-oriented programming features provided by C++. For example, applications
                                such as embedded systems are still typically programmed in C. Second, much of the
                                world still runs on C code, and those programs will continue to be enhanced and
                                maintained. While C's greatest legacy is as the foundation for C++, it will continue to
                                be a vibrant, widely used language for many years to come.</p>

                            <p>Your compiler may also support other extensions that help it take better advantage
                                of its specific environment.
                                All C (and C++) keywords are lowercase. Also, uppercase and lowercase are
                                different: else is a keyword; ELSE is not. You may not use a keyword for any other
                                purpose in a programâ€”that is, you may not use it as a variable or function name.
                                All C programs consist of one or more functions. The only function that must be
                                present is called main() , which is the first function called when program execution
                                begins. In well-written C code, main() contains what is, in essence, an outline of what
                                the program does. The outline is composed of function calls. Although main() is not
                                a keyword, treat it as if it were. For example, don't try to use main() as the name of a
                                variable because you will probably confuse the compiler.
                                The general form of a C program is illustrated in Figure 1-1, where f1() through
                                fN() represent user-defined functions.</p>

                            <h2>The Library and Linking</h2>
                            <p>Technically speaking, you can create a useful, functional C or C++ program that
                                consists solely of the statements that you actually created. However, this is quite
                                rare because neither C nor C++ provides any keywords that perform such things as
                                input/output (I/O) operations, high-level mathematical computations, or character
                                handling. As a result, most programs include calls to various functions contained in
                                the standard library.
                                All C++ compilers come with a standard library of functions that perform most
                                commonly needed tasks. Standard C++ specifies a minimal set of functions that will be
                                supported by all compilers. However, your compiler will probably contain many other
                                functions. For example, the standard library does not define any graphics functions,
                                but your compiler will probably include some.
                                The C++ standard library can be divided into two halves: the standard function
                                library and the class library. The standard function library is inherited from the C
                                language. C++ supports the entire function library defined by Standard C. Thus, all
                                of the standard C functions are available for use in C++ programs that you write.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the standard function library, C++ also defines its own class library.
                                The class library provides object-oriented routines that your programs may use. It also
                                defines the Standard Template Library (STL), which offers off-the-shelf solutions to a
                                variety of programming problems. However, both the class library and the STL are
                                discussed later in this book. In Part One, only the standard function library is used,
                                since it is the only one that is also defined by C.
                                The implementors of your compiler have already written most of the generalpurpose
                                functions that you will use. When you call a function that is not part of your
                                program, the compiler "remembers" its name. Later, the linker combines the code you
                                wrote with the
                                object code already found in the standard library. This process is called
                                linking. Some compilers have their own linker, while others use the standard linker
                                supplied by the operating system.
                                The functions in the library are in relocatable format. This means that the memory
                                addresses for the various machine-code instructions have not been absolutely
                                definedâ€”only offset information has been kept. When your program links with the
                                functions in the standard library, these memory offsets are used to create the actual
                                addresses used. There are several technical manuals and books that explain this
                                process in more detail. However, you do not need any further explanation of the
                                relocation process to program in C++.
                                Many of the functions that you will need as you write programs are in the standard
                                library. They act as building blocks that you combine. If you write a function that you
                                will use again and again, you can place it into a library, too.</p>

                            <h2>Separate Compilation</h2>
                            <p>Most short programs are completely contained within one source file. However, as a
                                program's length grows, so does its compile time (and long compile times make for
                                short tempers). Hence, C/C++ allows a program to be contained in many files and lets
                                you compile each file separately. Once you have compiled all files, they are linked,
                                along with any library routines, to form the complete object code. The advantage of
                                separate compilation is that if you change the code of one file, you do not need to
                                recompile the entire program. On all but the simplest projects, this saves a substantial
                                amount of time. The user documentation to your C/C++ compiler will contain
                                instructions for compiling multifile programs.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding the .C and .CPP File Extensions</h2>
                            <p>The programs in Part One of this book are, of course, valid C++ programs and can be
                                compiled using any modern C++ compiler. They are also valid C programs and can be
                                compiled using a C compiler. Thus, if you are called upon to write C programs, the
                                ones shown in Part One qualify as examples. Traditionally, C programs use the file
                                extension .C, and C++ programs use the extension .CPP. A C++ compiler uses the file
                                extension to determine what type of program it is compiling. This is important because
                                the compiler assumes that any program using the .C extension is a C program and that
                                any file using .CPP is a C++ program. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, you may use
                                either extension for the programs in Part One. However, the programs in the rest of
                                this book will require .CPP.
                                One last point: Although C is a subset of C++, there are a few minor differences
                                between the two languages, and in a few cases, you may need to compile a C program
                                as a C program (using the .C extension). Any instances of this will be noted.</p>
